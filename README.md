### üöÄ About Me
üéì With nearly two years of React experience and ongoing exploration of Vue.js and React Native, I'm dedicated to mastering diverse technologies. I am also pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering and will graduate mid-2025.

  üë®‚Äçüíª I enjoy enhancing my skills through avid reading, thoroughly absorbing You Don't Know JS, and frequently delving into articles on platforms like DEV Community and LinkedIn. In my spare time, I enjoy tackling problem-solving challenges on platforms like LeetCode and CodeWars, honing my coding skills through practical application and problem-solving.
