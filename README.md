 <h1>Hello there 👋, I'm Bekzod</h1>
### 🚀 About Me
🎓 With nearly two years of React experience and ongoing exploration of Vue.js and React Native, I'm dedicated to mastering diverse technologies. I am also pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering and will graduate in mid-2025.

👨‍💻 I find joy in enhancing my skills through avid reading, having thoroughly absorbed "You Don't Know JS" and frequently delving into articles on platforms like DEV Community and LinkedIn. In my spare time, I enjoy tackling problem-solving challenges on platforms like LeetCode and CodeWars, honing my coding skills through practical application and problem-solving.
