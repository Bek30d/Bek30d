### 🚀 About Me
🎓 With nearly two years of React experience and ongoing exploration of Vue.js and React Native, I'm dedicated to mastering diverse technologies. I am also pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering and will graduate in mid-2025.

👨‍💻 I find joy in enhancing my skills through avid reading, having thoroughly absorbed "You Don't Know JS" and frequently delving into articles on platforms like DEV Community and LinkedIn.
